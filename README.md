Very simple zsh, bash, vim, and terminal set ups.

## Oh My ZSH!

Installing [Oh My ZSH!](https://ohmyz.sh/) will wipe your existing .zshrc file and replace it with a default one. 

So install Oh My ZSH! first, then replace the new config with the one in this repo.

## Change default shell to Zsh

Enter

```
$ chsh -s /bin/zsh
```

Then enter your password.

## Change default shell to Bash

Enter

```
$ chsh -s /bin/bash
```

Then enter your password.
