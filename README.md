Very simple zsh, bash, vim, and iterm2 set ups.

## Oh My ZSH!

Installing [Oh My ZSH!](https://ohmyz.sh/) will wipe your existing .zshrc file and replace it with a default one. 

So install Oh My ZSH! first, then replace the new config with the one in this repo.

The theme is set to "agnoster", but my config is slighly different than the default one.

Replace the new file with the old one at

```
.oh-my-zsh/themes/agnoster.zsh-theme
```

## Change default shell to Zsh

Enter

```
$ chsh -s /bin/zsh
```

Then enter your password.

## Change default shell to Bash

Enter

```
$ chsh -s /bin/bash
```

Then enter your password.
